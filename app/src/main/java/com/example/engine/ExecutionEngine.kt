/**
 * Phase 4 (Spec §36, §22, §25): the execution gate between the Campaign Library and
 * order routing.
 *
 * [gateStaging] runs the previously-dead [RiskEngine.validateCampaignStaging] on every
 * board (kill switch, daily loss stop, venue health, side conflict, gross exposure) and
 * then applies the operator's ExecutionMode:
 *  - SHADOW: campaigns stay PLANNED with no resting slices — alerts only, no orders.
 *  - PAPER: boards rest internally and fill against the live price via
 *    [simulatePaperFills] — no exchange calls.
 *  - CAPPED_LIVE: real routing, but each board's notional is clipped to
 *    [RiskEnvelope.cappedNotionalPerCampaignUsd].
 *  - SCALED_LIVE: full-size routing; requires an active signed session like CAPPED.
 *
 * Live modes without an active session hold boards as PLANNED rather than silently
 * dropping them, so the operator sees exactly what is waiting for credentials.
