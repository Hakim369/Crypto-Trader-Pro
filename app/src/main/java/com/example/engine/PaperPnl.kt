/**
 * §5/§36 Paper-wallet accounting: pure, deterministic functions that derive exposure
 * and PnL from the campaign ladders actually filled in paper mode, so the RiskEnvelope
 * reflects what the paper wallet is really doing — no invented demo values, no random
 * draws, and never mixed with the §37 replay-benchmark PnL.
 *
 * Model:
 *  - Open exposure  = sum of filled-slice notional (a filled slice is an open position).
 *  - Unrealized PnL = direction-aware (mark - entry) * qty per filled slice.
 *  - Realized PnL   = booked once when a filled board is flattened: at the board's hard
 *    stop price for invalidation/operator flattens (conservative), or at the caller's
 *    price for a kill-switch flatten.
 *  - 1R             = accountEquityUsd * riskPerCampaignPct / 100 (the configured
 *    per-campaign risk budget), matching the sizing math.
